<p><strong>MIDI Transpose</strong><em>&nbsp;</em>09.24.2025</p>
<p>In early 2022 I began collecting and repairing musical instruments and recording paraphernalia sourced from thrift stores in the general Seattle area. Many of these units featured rudimentary MIDI implementation, not easily integrated with modern software that assumes built-in editing of MIDI mapping. To solve this problem, I created <span class="endnote" data-id="1" data-content="<strong>MIDI_Transpose.amxd</strong> - Ten channel MIDI-shifter for Ableton Live. <a href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/13EAtB5ZRBxObcBNnHemRsjEtaZJC7EvW/view?usp=share_link' target='_blank'>download</a>">MIDI_Transpose.amxd<sup>1</sup></span>, a ten channel Max device for Ableton Live that allows simple remapping of MIDI input. This device is primitive, but proved invaluable when integrating particularly old and/or cheap hardware into a modern DAW-based workflow.</p>
